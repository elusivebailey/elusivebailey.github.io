The AudioFiles is a blog about art and science.

I have degrees in both physics and music. While most people question what one has to do with the other, I believe physics can describe the fundamentals of just about any topic, music included. I use the two together to approach my work in acoustics from both a scientific and artistic perspective.

Besides playing the piano and various percussion instruments, I also enjoy other artistic endeavors such as drawing, painting, ceramics, knitting, and writing. I love to lift weights, go for walks and hikes, and generally explore the outdoors. I would consider myself a life long learner and perpetual geek since I am an insatiable book worm. Finally, I am owned by a cat named Arwen Evenstar who is way too furry and won't stop yelling at me.
